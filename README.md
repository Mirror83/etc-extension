# ETC VSCode Extension

This is a simple VSCode extension that creates a notification in the editor after every 10th save. The notification simply asks, "ETC?".
ETC is an acronym for **E**asy **T**o **C**hange, and I encountered it in the second chapter of the book: [The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/)

One of the challenges at the end of one of the book's section (Topic 8: The Essence of Good Design), is to do something like this so as to build the habit of thinking about and writing code that is easy to change. The notifications constantly remind one to evaluate any change they are making, and its alignment with this value.

This challenge was a good idea for a simple first VSCode extension.
